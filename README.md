24/7 minecraft afk bot (mineflayer)

basically a super stable bot i built to keep my server online 24/7 it's perfect for aternos or minehut i added a custom 15s physics delay because purpur and paper servers kept breaking with coordinate sync errors

what it does
- fixes spawn errors: stops those annoying 'true/false' packet crashes when you first join
- login support: it handles /login and /register commands automatically if you're on a cracked server
- stay undetected: it moves its head around at random times so afk kickers don't catch it
- runs forever: works with .github/workflows so it just restarts itself if it ever goes down

how to use it
1 grab the library: npm install mineflayer
2 throw your server ip/port into index.js (i left comments in the code to show you where)
3 fire it up: node index.js

github actions
this repo is already set up with a workflow the code is designed to kill the process if it gets disconnected, which lets github actions automatically reboot it and get it back in the game
